# SQL-data-cleaning
SQL data cleaning is the process of using SQL (Structured Query Language) to identify and correct issues within raw datasets stored in databases. The goal is to ensure the data is accurate, consistent, and reliable before it is used for reporting, analytics, or feeding into business applications and machine learning models.

In real-world scenarios, raw data often contains errors like duplicates, missing values, typos, inconsistent formats, or irrelevant information. SQL offers powerful tools to clean and transform this data directly within the database.
